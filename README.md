Here we are presenting the script files of our computational models which are built using Lumerical FDTD software.

Details of Spherical Model

Spherical models consist of an inner layer of varying diameters (0.5 µm, 4 µm, 1µm, 2 µm, 3 µm, 4 µm, 5 µm, 6 µm, 7 µm, 8 µm, 9 µm, 10 µm) and a surface layer of 50 nm thickness. Inner layer of the spherical model is built from a material with refractive index of 1.37 which represents the cytoplasm of biological cells while the surface layer is built from different materials of varying refractive indices (between 1.5-2.0) to find out the minimum refractive index for each model of varying diameters. Also, we have integrated Gaussian distributed random particles of varying sizes (diameters between 10-50 nm) into our models. Refractive index of these particles is 1.5 which represents the inclusion bodies of silicatein and reflectin proteins. These random particles also represent other structures and molecules inside biological cells which have higher reflectivity than cytoplasm. 

The time domain model we have designed is run on 2-dimensions (on the x-y plane) with uniaxial anisotropic PML boundaries. We have specified the background material as H2O(water)-Palik to represent biological cells inside water. Our time domain model runs at 320K temperature to make it close to the cell's real environment. We have meshed the FDTD with a maximum of 20 nm steps. As final settings of the FDTD, we have run the simulation more than 2000 fs to allow the simulation to have more time than needed to make it flawless whereas we have run the simulation with “early shutdown" function closed. This functionality allows us on some models to obtain resonance modes although that resonance modes may not be accessible on experimental settings because the power level of the waves are on the order of -10 to -13 arbitrary units when we start with 1 arbitrary unit power source.

We have used a “frequency domain field and power” monitor to find the resonance modes, then obtain the heatmaps on those resonance points using a “frequency domain field profile” monitor. We have applied a full apodization filter at 1000 fs center with 500 fs time-width to filter out the initial and final response of the cavity to the power sources.

Details of Toroidal Model

Toroidal models consist of an inner layer of varying radiuses (1 µm, 1.5 µm, 2 µm, 2.5 µm, 3 µm, 3.5µm, 4 µm) with 1µm cross section, and a surface layer of 50nm thickness. Inner layer of the toroidal model is built from a material with refractive index of 1.37 which represents the cytoplasm of biological cells while the surface layer is built from different materials of varying refractive indices (between 1.5 and 2.0) to find out the minimum refractive index for each models of varying diameters. Also, we have integrated Gaussian distributed random particles of varying sizes (diameters between 10-50 nm) into our models. Refractive index of these particles is 1.5 which represent structures and molecules inside biological cells which have higher reflectivity than cytoplasm. 

The time domain model we have designed is run on 2-dimensions (on the x-y plane) with uniaxial anisotropic PML boundaries. We have specified the background material as H20(water)-Palik to represent biological cells inside water. Our time domain model runs at 320K temperature to make it close to the cell's real environment. We have meshed the FDTD with a maximum of 20 nm steps. As final settings of the FDTD, we have run the simulation more than 2000 fs to allow the simulation to have more time than needed to make it flawless whereas we have run the simulation with “early shutoff” function closed. This functionality allows us on some models to obtain resonance modes although that resonance modes may not be accessible on experimental settings because the power level of the waves are on the order of -10 to -13 arbitrary units when we start with 1 arbitrary unit power source. 

We have used a “frequency domain field and power” monitor to find the resonance modes, then obtain the heatmaps on those resonance points using a “frequency domain field profile” monitor. We have applied a full apodization filter at 1000 fs center with 500 fs time-width to filter out the initial and final response of the cavity to the power sources. 

Please note that we have named script files of toroidal models as "donut cavity".
